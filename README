libbsd - Utility functions from BSD systems

This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems,
and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port
projects with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same
code over and over again on each project.

A BSD compatible message-digest library is required, on systems where
this is not provided by its libc or libmd libraries, the canonical
implementation to use is <https://www.hadrons.org/software/libmd/>.
